# HundensVaggaRemastered
A point-and-click adventure game in the style of e.g. Myst. A remake of a project that me and my friend did in gymnasiet (high school).

Implemented in C# with the [MonoGame framework](http://www.monogame.net). Also uses [Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).

A good entry point for the project is the `Main.cs` class.
